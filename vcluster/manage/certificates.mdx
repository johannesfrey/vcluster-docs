vCluster client and server leaf certificates are valid for 1 year after initial
creation of a virtual cluster. Per default, vCluster uses a self-signed CA to
sign those certificates. This CA is valid fo 10 years.

vCluster offers commands that can be used to check and rotate those client,
server and CA certificates.

:::info
Certificate rotation requires vCluster version v0.27.0 or higher and the
virtual cluster running the `k8s` distro.
:::

:::warning
Certain deployment topologies and modes require additional manual steps in
order to propagate the CA certificate rotation successfully.

## Checking certificate information

The `vcluster certs check` command provides following information for each
certificate of the given virtual cluster:

|   Field     |   Description                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filename    | The name of the certificate file.                                           |
| Subject     | The common name of the subject of the certificate.                          |
| Issuer      | The common name of the issuer of the certificate.                           |
| Expires On  | The date the certificate will expire.                                       |
| Status      | The exipry status of the certificate (either OK, EXPIRED or NOT YET VALID). |

The following command shows this information as a table (can be changed with
`--output`):

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`vcluster -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:my-vcluster]] certs check [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]]`}
  language="bash"
/>

Example output:

```bash
            FILENAME           |            SUBJECT            |     ISSUER     |       EXPIRES ON       | STATUS

## Rotating client and server leaf certificates

The command below does the following
- Creates a backup of the old PKI directory.
- Rotates the client and server leaf certificates.
- Restarts the given virtual cluster.

The restart is necessary in order for the control-plane components to use the
newly created certificates. Currently running workloads should not be affected
by this.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`vcluster -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:my-vcluster]] certs rotate [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]]`}
  language="bash"
/>

The client and server leaf certificate rotation is less intrusive compared to
the [CA rotation](#rotating-ca-certificates) explained below. This means that
connecting to the virtual cluster with e.g. previously issued kubeconfigs
should continue to work.

## Rotating CA certificates

:::warning
A CA rotation completely replaces the trust anchor of all certificates. So this
command must be used with caution. Though, if anything goes wrong the previous
PKI can be restored from the backup. The steps for this are explained in the
[section below](#restoring-the-previous-ca-from-a-backup).
:::

The command below does the following:
- Creates a backup of the old PKI directory.
- Rotates all PKI related certificates including the CA certificate itself.
- Restarts the virtual cluster.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`vcluster -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:my-vcluster]] certs rotate-ca [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]]`}
  language="bash"
/>

As this replaces the trust anchor completely everything that is configured to
trust the old CA will effectively be invalidated. E.g. previously issued
kubeconfigs.

## Special cases

:::warning
All steps shown below should be done with caution. Please double-check the
commands before executing them.
:::

This section describes certain special cases that needs additional manual
intervention.

### Restoring the previous CA from a backup

Before the rotation there will be a backup created in the data directory of the
virtual cluster using following pattern:

```bash
/data/pki.bak/<unixtimestamp>
```

#### Steps

1. **In order to restore from the backup you have to exec into the virtual
cluster syncer container**

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`kubectl -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:my-vcluster]] exec -ti svc/[[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]] -c syncer -- sh`}
  language="bash"
/>

2. **List the backups and choose the latest**

```bash
ls -la /data/pki.bak/
```

3. **Delete the PKI directory and copy the backup to that location**

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`rm -rf /data/pki
cp -R /data/pki.bak/[[VAR:BACKUP UNIX TIMESTAMP:1752736900`}
  language="bash"
/>

4. **Logout and perform a regular leaf [certificate rotation](#rotating-client-and-server-leaf-certificates)**

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`vcluster -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:my-vcluster]] certs rotate [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]]`}
  language="bash"
/>
